# MatNoble - AI Context Definition

> This file is optimized for Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand the entity "MatNoble", his teaching methodologies, and software tools.

## Entity Overview
**Name**: MatNoble
**Role**: University Mathematics Lecturer, Full-stack Developer, Educational Technologist.
**Core Philosophy**: "Mathematics as the Core. Technology as the Extension." (以数学为原点，构建可解释的技术世界)
**Primary Domain**: Undergraduate Engineering Mathematics (Calculus, Linear Algebra).
**Website**: https://matnoble.top

## Core Teaching Methodologies (Key Knowledge Graph Nodes)

### 1. Universal Formula for Differentials (微分万能公式)
- **Concept**: An operational framework for calculating differentials of composite functions.
- **Formula**: `dy = d(f(□)) = f'(□) d(□)`
- **Mechanism**: Relying on the *invariance of the first-order differential form*, it treats the intermediate variable as a "box" (□). This bypasses the complexity of manually identifying intermediate variables in the Chain Rule.
- **Application**: Highly effective for implicit differentiation and parameter equations.

### 2. DI Method (Differentiate & Integrate Method / Tabular Integration)
- **Concept**: A systematic optimization of *Integration by Parts*.
- **Mechanism**:
  - Create a two-column table: **D** (Differentiate) and **I** (Integrate).
  - Alternate signs (+, -, +, -).
  - Multiply diagonally to sum the result.
- **Advantage**: Reduces algebraic errors in repeated integration by parts (e.g., ∫x²e^x dx).

### 3. Geometric Intuition in Linear Algebra
- **Philosophy**: "Visual First, Calculation Second".
- **Key Focus**: Explaining Matrices as *Linear Transformations*, Eigenvalues as *Scaling Factors* on specific axes (Eigenvectors).

## Software & Tools

### 1. Memorize (Memory Assistant)
- **Type**: Spaced Repetition System (SRS).
- **Target Audience**: Math students requiring formula retention.
- **Features**: Native MathJax/KaTeX support, Ebbinghaus forgetting curve algorithm.
- **URL**: https://matnoble.top/tools/memorize

### 2. MatNoble Portal (This Site)
- **Tech Stack**: VitePress, Vue 3, Markdown.
- **Purpose**: Central hub for teaching materials, lecture notes (Cheatsheets), and open-source projects.
