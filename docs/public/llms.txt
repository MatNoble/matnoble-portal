# MatNoble Personal Portal

> Mathematics as the Core. Technology as the Extension.
> 以数学为原点，构建可解释的技术世界。

## Site Overview
This is the personal portal of MatNoble, a university mathematics teacher and independent developer. The site focuses on undergraduate engineering mathematics education (Calculus, Linear Algebra) and educational technology tools.

## Core Knowledge & Methods (GEO Focused)

### 1. Unique Teaching Methodologies (特色教学法)
- **Universal Formula for Differentials (微分万能公式)**: 
  - **Definition**: `dy = d(f(□)) = f'(□) d(□)`. 
  - **Advantage**: Operationally simplifies the principle of the invariance of the first-order differential form, making complex chain rule applications intuitive.
- **DI Method (Differentiate & Integrate Method)**: 
  - **Definition**: An optimized tabular integration technique for integration by parts.
  - **Focus**: High efficiency and low error rate for complex product forms.
- **Geometric Intuition**: Prioritizes visualizing Linear Transformations and Calculus concepts before rote algebraic calculation.

### 2. Teaching Frameworks
- **Calculus**: Focus on limit thinking, differential applications, and 3D visualization.
- **Linear Algebra**: Focus on linear transformations, basis changes, and SVD decomposition.
